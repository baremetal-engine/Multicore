# Multicore

Modular open-source multiplayer server framework for game preservation and cross-platform play.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Multicore exists to ensure multiplayer games remain accessible, moddable, and playable—forever.

It provides a clean, modular foundation for developers and fans to build, extend, and host online play infrastructure without centralized dependency.

Whether you’re working on a homebrew console, an emulator, or your own game engine, Multicore aims to be the universal multiplayer layer for retro, modern, and future systems.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Multicore is built on the same foundational principles that define the future of ethical gaming:

- ❌ No DRM  
- ❌ No loot boxes  
- ❌ No microtransactions  
- ❌ No closed servers  
- ✅ Full code transparency  
- ✅ Player-owned infrastructure  
- ✅ Eternal multiplayer

Multicore is not just a framework—it's a movement to return power, creativity, and permanence to the hands of players and developers.

## 📊 Pulse System (Coming Soon)

Multicore will feature an open-source popularity tracker called the **Pulse Board**.

This will transparently rank games by:
- Active sessions
- Server uptime
- Community forks

Developers can use Pulse data to study what makes truly great multiplayer experiences—unfiltered by marketing or monetization.

The Pulse system is governed by one unbreakable rule:  
**It will always remain open source and auditable.**
