# Multicore

Modular open-source multiplayer server framework for game preservation and cross-platform play across console, handheld, and PC.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Multicore exists to ensure multiplayer games remain accessible, moddable, and playable—forever.

It provides a clean, modular foundation for developers and fans to build, extend, and host online play infrastructure without centralized dependency.

Whether you're working with a console, handheld, mobile, or PC title—Multicore welcomes all platforms, eras, and architectures. If it had multiplayer, or should have, it belongs here.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Multicore is built on the same foundational principles that define the future of ethical gaming:

- ❌ No cheaters
- ❌ No censorship
- ❌ No DRM  
- ❌ No loot boxes  
- ❌ No microtransactions  
- ❌ No closed servers  
- ✅ Full code transparency  
- ✅ Player-owned infrastructure  
- ✅ Eternal multiplayer

Multicore is not just a framework—it's a movement to return power, creativity, and permanence to the hands of players and developers.

## 📊 Pulse System (Coming Soon)

Multicore will feature an open-source popularity tracker called the **Pulse Board**.

This will transparently rank games by:
- Active sessions
- Server uptime
- Community forks

Developers can use Pulse data to study what makes truly great multiplayer experiences—unfiltered by marketing or monetization.

The Pulse system is governed by one unbreakable rule:  
**It will always remain open source and auditable.**

- 🤖 **Future-Compatible with AI-Assisted Protocol Emulation**  
  Multicore is designed with modular architecture that will support future tools—such as AI-generated network adapters and clean-room protocol emulators—enabling broader support for legacy multiplayer environments.  

  This vision allows communities to preserve and restore online play for games with abandoned or undocumented network protocols, while respecting legal and ethical boundaries.
