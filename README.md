# Multicore

Modular open-source multiplayer server framework for game preservation and cross-platform play across console, handheld, and PC.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Multicore exists to ensure multiplayer games remain accessible, moddable, and playable—forever.

It provides a clean, modular foundation for developers and fans to build, extend, and host online play infrastructure without centralized dependency.

Whether you're working with a console, handheld, mobile, or a PC title — Multicore welcomes all platforms, eras, and architectures. If it had multiplayer, or should have, it belongs here.

- 🌐 **Cross-Platform Design**  
  Enables play across emulators, original consoles, and modern devices.

- 🛠️ **Clean-Room Focused**  
  Built to respect licensing boundaries. No proprietary code is included or hosted.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Multicore is built on the same foundational principles that define the future of ethical gaming:

- ❌ No cheaters
- ❌ No censorship
- ❌ No DRM  
- ❌ No loot boxes  
- ❌ No microtransactions  
- ❌ No closed servers  
- ✅ Full code transparency  
- ✅ Player-owned infrastructure  
- ✅ Eternal multiplayer

Multicore is not just a framework—it's a movement to return power, creativity, and permanence to the hands of players and developers.

## 📊 Pulse System: Multiplayer and Single-Player Analytics

The **Pulse System** is Multicore's open telemetry and popularity tracking layer.

It provides a transparent, community-driven look at which games are *actually* being played—across eras, platforms, and genres. Pulse supports both multiplayer and single-player games under one unified framework.

### 🔍 What Pulse Tracks

Each game entry may report:
- Total active sessions
- Average playtime
- Completion rate (where applicable)
- Multiplayer server count
- Mod activity or plugin presence
- Platform distribution (console, handheld, PC, emulator, CoreBox)

### 🎮 Game Modes Supported

- **Multiplayer**: Tracks server-hosted games, concurrent sessions, and match activity
- **Single-Player**: Tracks usage via self-hosted logs, frontends, or opt-in telemetry

All tracking is:
- 🔓 100% open source
- ❌ Never tied to user identity
- ✅ Verifiable through public code and data mirrors

### 📈 Why It Matters

- Uncovers which games *endure* — not just which games are marketed
- Exposes the long-term value of ethical design vs monetized churn
- Helps developers and players study what truly makes games fun
- Gives forgotten or indie titles a chance to shine on merit alone

The Pulse System is our cultural mirror—and it will always remain open to the public.

🤖 **Future-Compatible with AI-Assisted Protocol Emulation**  
  Multicore is designed with modular architecture that will support future tools—such as AI-generated network adapters and clean-room protocol emulators—enabling broader support for legacy multiplayer environments.  

  This vision allows communities to preserve and restore online play for games with abandoned or undocumented network protocols, while respecting legal and ethical boundaries.
