# Contributing to Multicore

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Multicore** — a modular open-source multiplayer server framework dedicated to preserving and elevating online gaming.

To maintain the integrity and mission of the project, we ask that all contributors follow the guidelines below.

---

## 🧱 Core Principles

* 🔓 **Open Source Only**: No proprietary, decompiled, or copyrighted code.
* 🧪 **Clean-Room Ethic**: Reimplement behavior from traffic analysis, documentation, or reverse-engineered understanding — not from disassembly.
* 🛠️ **Modular Design**: Keep features and protocols as plugins or optional modules wherever possible.
* 🔐 **License Respect**: Follow AGPL-3.0. If you use Multicore in a public or network-facing app, your code must also be published.
* 🧭 **Mission-Aligned**: No DRM. No closed forks. No cheating logic. No exploit code.
