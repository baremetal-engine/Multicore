# Governance: Multicore Project

Multicore exists to serve the public, not private interests. To protect this vision, the following governance model defines how decisions are made, how the project evolves, and how its mission remains intact.

---

## üîë Guiding Principles

* The project shall always remain **open source** under AGPL-3.0.
* All critical infrastructure (Pulse, protocol libraries, server logic) must remain **transparent and forkable**.
* Multicore may never be monetized in a way that imposes restrictions on end users (e.g. DRM, premium tiers, locked features).
* Community access, learning, and freedom take priority over speed, profit, or external partnerships.

---

## üß† Decision Structure

### 1. **Core Maintainers**

A small group of trusted contributors with long-term alignment to the project's vision. Their responsibilities:

* Merge or reject pull requests
* Guide technical direction
* Enforce contribution standards

All maintainers must agree to the AGPL-3.0 and sign a public pledge to uphold the principles in this document.

### 2. **Community Contributors**

Anyone may submit issues, discussions, or pull requests. Input is always welcome.
Contributors with consistent, high-integrity participation may be nominated as maintainers.

### 3. **Consensus Over Control**

Major decisions (e.g. architectural shifts, renaming, license changes) require:

* Public discussion
* Documented rationale
* Minimum 75% consensus from active core maintainers

---

## üîí Anti-Capture Measures

To protect Multicore from hostile forks, dilution, or corporate abuse:

* **No proprietary forks may use the name "Multicore" or claim protocol authority**
* Pulse System must remain open-source and auditable at all times
* Official documentation and protocol definitions must be versioned and mirrored publicly

---

## üß≠ Long-Term Custodianship

If the original founders become inactive, the project must:

* Default to a trusted mirror of the last known stable state
* Continue under AGPL-3.0 in any fork or successor
* Be passed to a community-chosen maintainer group via transparent GitHub transition or Git consensus tools

## ‚úçÔ∏è Final Word

Multicore belongs to no person, company, or government. It is a public multiplayer protocol ‚Äî designed to remain in the hands of those who use, protect, and improve it.

**No closed fork will ever be the real Multicore.**
