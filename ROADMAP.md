# Multicore Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the vision and high-level priorities for Multicore ‚Äî an open-source framework to make multiplayer games immortal and universally accessible. While the founder is not a developer, the mission is clear:

> **Enable any developer to take their favorite game and make multiplayer possible ‚Äî for everyone, forever.**

Multicore is built to empower those who resonate with that mission.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (LIVE)

This phase laid the groundwork for everything Multicore represents. It established the licensing, values, and repository structure needed for global community collaboration.

**Key Deliverables:**

* Launched the official Multicore GitHub repository under AGPL-3.0

* Wrote and published core documents:

  * `README.md` (mission, scope)
  * `VISION.md` (philosophy and future)
  * `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `MAINTAINER_PLEDGE.md`

* Defined the Pulse System as an open framework for multiplayer + single-player analytics

* Framed the modular plugin strategy for future game protocol support

* [x] Launch GitHub repo under AGPL-3.0

* [x] Define mission, vision, contributing, governance, and maintainer pledge

* [x] Establish modular plugin framework concept

* [x] Create Pulse System concept for multiplayer + single-player analytics

## üîÑ Phase 2: Infrastructure Prototypes (In Progress)

This phase focuses on creating the core systems that will power all future Multicore modules. It includes the architecture, server framework, and telemetry logic needed to support scalable multiplayer modules and game-specific plugins.

**Key Objectives:**

* Build a lightweight and modular server core with plugin injection

* Create boilerplate adapters for easy protocol emulation

* Begin implementation of anonymous analytics via Pulse v0.1

* Set up diagnostic logging and error handling layers

* [ ] Build core server architecture with plugin support

* [ ] Develop basic matchmaking and lobby modules

* [ ] Launch opt-out anonymous telemetry backend (Pulse v0.1)

* [ ] Build protocol adapter boilerplates

* [ ] Establish a clean logging/debug system

---

## üîç Phase 3: Community-Driven Protocol Support

This phase turns Multicore into a living platform by inviting developers to contribute support for the multiplayer games they love. It decentralizes development by prioritizing clean-room, plugin-based game support.

**Key Objectives:**

* Grow contributor community by targeting retro game dev spaces (e.g. Batocera, RetroArch)

* Encourage safe, clean protocol replication with legally sound guides

* Create a plugin validation testbed for protocol emulation

* Add support for historically significant games with strong multiplayer legacies

* [ ] Encourage devs to add clean-room multiplayer support for their favorite games

* [ ] Accept protocol plugins (e.g. Quake, Halo CE, Battlefront II)

* [ ] Provide guides for traffic sniffing and behavior emulation (legally safe)

* [ ] Enable testbed environments for plugin validation

---

## üìä Phase 4: Pulse System Rollout

This phase brings visibility and accountability to preserved multiplayer and single-player experiences. It gives recognition to games based on active player interest ‚Äî not monetization or marketing.

**Key Objectives:**

* Launch the public Pulse leaderboard with filtering by game type, platform, and activity

* Integrate Pulse with modular servers to automatically log usage anonymously

* Support visual dashboards embeddable into emulator frontends and homebrew consoles

* [ ] Publish first open leaderboard of most-played games

* [ ] Allow filtering by single-player, multiplayer, platform, and activity

* [ ] Make Pulse dashboard embeddable into frontends and emulators

---

## üîÑ Phase 5: Multiplayer Refinement

This phase strengthens Multicore‚Äôs robustness and usability. With real-world use growing, it's time to scale reliability, expand support tools, and make launching/joining multiplayer easier for players.

**Key Objectives:**

* Improve connection resilience through NAT traversal and relay encryption

* Add admin and moderation tools for hosted servers (e.g. bans, logs, server configs)

* Enable federated master lists so communities can self-host discovery servers

* Allow seamless server launching from within UI frontends

* [ ] Expand encryption, relay, and NAT traversal support

* [ ] Add server moderation tools, bans, and config UIs

* [ ] Support federated master server lists

* [ ] Allow dedicated or peer-hosted server launching from frontend

---

## üåç Phase 6: Ecosystem & Documentation

This phase focuses on making the project scalable for long-term contributors and easy to adopt for newcomers. It will professionalize the documentation and improve developer onboarding.

**Key Objectives:**

* Build and publish a dedicated documentation site (docs.multicore.network)

* Set up GitHub Actions pipelines for validation and code quality

* Package reusable SDKs and helper utilities

* Highlight community-run Multicore game servers as case studies

* [ ] Launch full developer docs site

* [ ] Create GitHub Actions CI for modules

* [ ] Package SDKs and helper tools for modders

* [ ] Showcase community-run server case studies

---

## ü§ñ Phase 7: AI-Assisted Protocol Emulation

This phase prepares Multicore to harness AI for decoding, modeling, and generating server logic for games that are too complex, encrypted, or undocumented to support via manual clean-room engineering alone.

**Key Objectives:**

* Design interfaces for AI-generated protocol adapters
* Build safe sandbox environments for testing AI-reconstructed multiplayer behavior
* Feed AI tools with legal inputs (packet captures, documented behavior, public logs)
* Enable gradual training via community feedback loops to improve accuracy
* Use AI modules to resurrect multiplayer support for games previously thought impossible

## üß† Vision Beyond Code

This project is not about control. It‚Äôs about liberation.

Every time a multiplayer game is lost to shutdowns, the Pulse fades.
Multicore exists to keep that Pulse alive ‚Äî for every game, every player, every platform.

**If you‚Äôre a developer with love for a lost game, this is your call.**

You don‚Äôt need permission. You already have it.

Let‚Äôs make multiplayer immortal.
